        <h1> Description </h1>
        <p> <b>Coco lumber</b>is derived from mature coconut trees that have reached the 
            end of their fruit-bearing life. It is widely available in the Philippines 
            due to the country’s extensive coconut plantations.</p>

        <p> <b>Coco lumber</b>is an innovative and sustainable alternative to traditional 
            hardwood. Instead of cutting down forest trees, coco lumber makes use of 
            aging coconut palms that would otherwise be discarded or burned. This 
            practice helps reduce deforestation while maximizing the value of existing 
            agricultural resources.</p>
        <p> The wood varies in density, with the outer portion being extremely hard and 
            durable, while the inner core is softer. When properly treated and processed,
            coco lumber becomes resistant to pests, moisture, and decay. Its distinctive 
            grain pattern gives it a unique aesthetic that sets it apart from 
            conventional timber.</p>
        <p> <b>Coco lumber</b>is increasingly used in both rural and urban construction, 
            particularly in affordable housing and eco-conscious architectural projects.</p>
