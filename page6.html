        <h2> Raffia </h2>
        <img class="sticky" src="raffiadesc1.jpg" alt="raffia">
        <p> Raffian is a lightweight yet durable woven material commonly used in the Philippines for handicrafts, 
            fashion accessories, and packaging applications. It is typically derived from natural plant fibers, 
            particularly from raffia palm leaves, which are carefully harvested, stripped, dried, and processed 
            into long, flexible strands suitable for weaving. In many Filipino<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> communities, especially in 
            provinces known for handicraft production, raffian serves as a primary material for creating bags, 
            hats, mats, baskets, and decorative items. Its availability and ease of processing make it an 
            accessible resource for small-scale industries and local artisans.
            The physical characteristics of raffian make it highly suitable for various practical and decorative 
            purposes. It has a slightly coarse yet pliable texture that allows it to be braided, twisted, or 
            woven without breaking easily. Naturally, it comes in neutral shades such as beige, cream, or 
            light brown, giving it an earthy and organic appearance. However, it can also be dyed into vibrant 
            colors to match contemporary design trends and consumer preferences. When tightly woven, raffian 
            exhibits moderate tensile strength, allowing finished products to withstand regular handling and 
            light loads. In the Philippine tropical climate, raffian performs well when properly processed and stored. The 
            material is breathable and lightweight, which helps prevent heat buildup when used in wearable 
            items like hats and bags. Although it can absorb moisture due to its natural fiber composition, 
            proper drying and storage significantly improve its durability and longevity. Its flexibility 
            also enables artisans to create intricate patterns and detailed craftsmanship, showcasing Filipino 
            creativity and traditional weaving techniques.
            Beyond its functional properties, raffian is valued for its environmental sustainability and 
            cultural significance. As a plant-based and biodegradable material, it serves as an eco-friendly 
            alternative to synthetic plastics and non-biodegradable packaging materials. Its continued use 
            supports local livelihoods and preserves traditional crafting skills passed down through 
            generations. Overall, raffian remains an important material in the Philippines, combining 
            practicality, sustainability, and cultural heritage in both everyday and decorative products.</span></p>

        <h2> Types of Raffia</h2>
        <h3> Natural Raffia Fiber </h3>
        <p> Natural raffia fiber in the Philippines is derived from the leaves of the raffia palm, particularly 
            the species Raphia farinifera. The long leaves are carefully harvested, stripped into thin fibers, and 
            sun-dried to preserve their strength and flexibility. This process retains the material’s natural 
            beige to light brown color, giving it an earthy and organic appearance that is highly valued in 
            traditional Filipino crafts. Because it is plant-based, natural raffia is biodegradable and 
            environmentally friendly, making it a sustainable alternative to synthetic materials.</p>
        <p> This type of raffia is widely used in local handicrafts such as woven bags, hats, mats, and 
            baskets. Filipino artisans prefer natural raffia for its authentic texture and its ability to 
            hold intricate weaving patterns without easily breaking. When tightly woven, it provides moderate 
            strength suitable for everyday items. Its breathable and lightweight quality also makes it 
            comfortable for wearable products, especially in the tropical climate of the Philippines.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="c">
        <h3> Dyed Raffia </h3>
        <img src="raffiatype2.webp">
        <p> Dyed raffia is natural raffia fiber that has undergone a coloring process using natural or synthetic 
            dyes. After harvesting and drying, the fibers are immersed in dye solutions to achieve vibrant 
            shades such as red, blue, green, yellow, and even pastel tones. This process enhances the visual 
            appeal of the material while maintaining most of its original flexibility and texture. Dyed 
            raffia allows artisans to experiment with creative and modern designs.</p>
        <p> In the Philippines, dyed raffia is commonly used in fashion accessories, souvenir items, and 
            decorative crafts. It is especially popular in tourist destinations where colorful handcrafted 
            products are in demand. The bright hues make woven items more attractive and marketable, blending 
            traditional weaving techniques with contemporary style. Despite being dyed, the material still 
            maintains the lightweight and breathable properties of natural raffia.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="d">
        <h3> Synthetic Raffia (Plastic Raffia) </h3>
        <img src="raffiatype3.jpg">
        <p> Synthetic raffia, often referred to as plastic raffia, is manufactured from polypropylene or 
            other plastic-based materials instead of plant fibers. Unlike natural raffia, it has a smoother 
            texture and more uniform thickness. It is also more resistant to water, mold, and prolonged 
            moisture exposure, making it highly durable for heavy-duty use. Synthetic raffia is typically 
            mass-produced, ensuring consistent quality and availability.</p>
        <p> In the Philippines, synthetic raffia is commonly used for packaging, tying agricultural products, 
            and weaving market bags. It is popular in commercial and industrial settings because of its 
            strength and affordability. Although it lacks the biodegradable quality of natural raffia, it 
            provides greater resistance to wear and tear, especially in humid environments. Its practicality 
            makes it widely used in both rural and urban areas.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="e">
        <h3> Raffia Twine or Raffia String </h3>
        <img src="raffiatype4.png">
        <p>Raffia twine or raffia string refers to raffia fibers that are processed into thinner strands or 
            twisted into rope-like forms. These strands can be made from either natural or synthetic raffia. 
            The twisting process increases the material’s tensile strength, making it suitable for binding and 
            fastening purposes. It is flexible enough to be tied securely without easily snapping.</p>
        <p> In the Philippines, raffia twine is frequently used for gift wrapping, floral arrangements, and 
            decorative tying in events and celebrations. It is also utilized in agricultural settings for 
            tying plants or bundling materials. Because of its simple yet rustic appearance, raffia twine is 
            popular in eco-themed decorations and packaging. Its versatility makes it useful for both 
            functional and ornamental applications.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="f">
        <h3> Processed or Soft Raffia </h3>
        <p> Processed or soft raffia undergoes additional treatment to improve its smoothness and flexibility. 
            This may involve soaking, conditioning, or refining the fibers to remove rough edges and enhance 
            comfort. The result is a softer texture that is more suitable for wearable items. While it 
            maintains the lightweight nature of traditional raffia, it feels gentler to the touch.</p>
        <p> In the Philippines, soft raffia is often used in the production of hats, sandals, handbags, and 
            other fashion accessories. Artisans prefer this type when creating items that come into direct 
            contact with the skin. The improved texture allows for detailed craftsmanship without causing 
            discomfort to users. This type of raffia combines traditional material qualities with enhanced 
            usability for modern consumers.</p>
