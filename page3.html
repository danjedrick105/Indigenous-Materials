        <h1> Capiz Shell </h1>
            <img src="capdes.webp">
        <p> <b>Capiz shell</b> is derived from the windowpane oyster <strong>(Placuna placenta)</strong>, a 
            marine mollusk traditionally harvested in shallow coastal waters of the 
            Philippines. The name “Capiz” originates from the province of Capiz in Panay 
            Island, which historically became a major center for harvesting, processing, 
            and trading this material. For centuries, Capiz shell has been deeply embedded 
            in Filipino culture, craftsmanship, and architectural identity. Capiz shell 
            is best known for its natural translucency, which allows light to pass 
            through softly while diffusing glare. Unlike glass, it produces a warm, 
            gentle glow that creates a calming and elegant atmosphere. When processed and 
            polished, Capiz shells exhibit a pearly sheen with subtle organic textures, 
            making each piece visually unique.</p>
    </section>
    
    <div class="b">
        <h2> Types of Capiz Shell </h2>
        <h3> Natural Capiz </h3>

    <img src="shelltype1.jpg">
        <p> Natural Capiz refers to Capiz shells that are minimally processed in order to 
            preserve their original appearance and organic characteristics. This type 
            retains the shell’s natural pearly white to off-white translucence, which 
            gently filters light and produces a soft, diffused glow. Each piece of 
            Natural Capiz is unique, displaying subtle variations in thickness, texture, 
            and tone, as well as fine striations and irregular edges that reflect its 
            marine origin The natural imperfections found in this type are highly valued, as they 
            contribute to its authenticity and artisanal quality. Rather than appearing 
            uniform or artificial, Natural Capiz emphasizes the beauty of natural 
            materials and traditional craftsmanship. Because of this, it is widely used 
            in heritage restorations, particularly in Spanish-era bahay na bato houses, 
            churches, and historical structures where Capiz shells were originally used 
            as window panes.</p>

        <p> In contemporary design, Natural Capiz is favored in minimalist, tropical, 
            and eco-inspired interiors. It complements wood, bamboo, rattan, and other 
            organic materials, making it ideal for spaces that aim to highlight 
            simplicity, sustainability, and cultural identity. Its neutral tone allows 
            it to blend harmoniously with various color palettes while still providing 
            visual texture and depth. </p></div>

        <div class="c">
        <h3> Dyed Capiz </h3>

        <img src="shelltype2.jpg">
        <p> Dyed Capiz shells undergo a coloring process in which natural pigments or modern dyes are applied to enhance their 
            visual appeal. This process allows Capiz to be produced in a wide range of colors, 
            including gold, silver, blue, green, red, amber, and soft pastel shades, while still 
            maintaining its translucent quality. Light passing through dyed Capiz creates a more 
            dramatic and expressive effect compared to natural shells.This type is especially popular in decorative and artistic applications, as 
            it gives designers greater creative freedom. Dyed Capiz can be arranged in 
            patterns, gradients, or contrasting color schemes to suit modern, 
            contemporary, or eclectic interiors. Despite the added color, the shell’s 
            natural texture and pearlescent sheen remain visible, preventing it from 
            looking flat or artificial. Dyed Capiz is commonly used in statement lighting fixtures, such as 
            chandeliers, pendant lamps, and wall sconces, where color and light interact 
            to create visually striking effects. It is also widely applied in event 
            décor, hotel interiors, retail displays, and festive installations, where 
            bold visual impact is desired. In addition, dyed Capiz is often used in wall 
            art, ornaments, and accessories to add vibrancy while still reflecting 
            Filipino craftsmanship.</p></div>

            <div class="d">
        <h3> Pressed Capiz </h3>

        <img src="shelltype3.webp">
        <p> Pressed Capiz is produced through a process in which raw Capiz shells are 
            carefully flattened, trimmed, and shaped into uniform panels, tiles, or 
            sheets. This treatment results in smoother surfaces, consistent thickness, 
            and more regular edges, making it easier to integrate into modern 
            construction and interior design applications. While more refined in 
            appearance, pressed Capiz still retains the shell’s natural translucency and 
            subtle iridescence.</p>

        <p> Because of its standardized form, Pressed Capiz is well-suited for 
            contemporary architectural elements that require precision and uniformity. 
            It is commonly used in wall claddings, ceiling panels, cabinet inlays, 
            furniture surfaces, and decorative partitions. Designers often combine 
            pressed Capiz with metal frames, glass, or engineered wood to create a 
            balance between natural texture and modern structure.</p>

        <p> Pressed Capiz is also ideal for modular decorative installations, where 
            repetition and alignment are essential. Its durability and ease of 
            installation make it practical for both residential and commercial spaces, 
            including hotels, restaurants, offices, and luxury retail environments. 
            This type bridges the gap between traditional material use and modern design 
            innovation, proving that Capiz shell can evolve while maintaining its 
            cultural significance.</p>

        <h2> 7 Uses & Application </h2>
        <div id="container">
        <div class="card"><h3> Lighting Fixtures </h3></div>
        <div class="card2"><p> Capiz shell is one of the most iconic materials used in lighting design in 
            the Philippines. It is commonly crafted into lampshades, chandeliers, 
            pendant lights, table lamps, and wall sconces, both in traditional and 
            modern forms. Its natural translucency allows light to pass through gently, 
            reducing harsh brightness and creating a soft, warm, and ambient glow that 
            enhances comfort and relaxation.</p>
        <p> Unlike glass or plastic, Capiz shell diffuses light in an organic way, 
            producing subtle shadows and reflections that add depth to interior spaces. 
            This quality makes it particularly suitable for living rooms, bedrooms, 
            dining areas, hotels, resorts, restaurants, spas, and wellness centers, 
            where mood lighting is essential. In luxury and hospitality settings, layered 
            Capiz shells are often arranged in cascading or overlapping patterns to create 
            dramatic yet soothing visual effects.</p></div>
        <img src="lightingfixtures.png"></div>

            <div id="container">
            <div class="card"><h3> Window Panels and Dividers </h3></div>
            <div class="card2"><p> Historically, Capiz shells were used as window panes in traditional 
                Filipino houses, especially during the Spanish colonial period, before 
                glass became widely available. Today, this traditional application has 
                evolved into modern uses such as decorative window panels, sliding doors, 
                folding screens, and room dividers.</p>
            <p> These applications allow natural or artificial light to pass through while maintaining privacy, ventilation, and 
                spatial separation. Capiz panels soften incoming daylight, reducing glare and heat 
                while creating a calm and inviting interior atmosphere. They are especially effective 
                in tropical architecture, open-plan homes, hotels, and cultural spaces, where airflow 
                and natural lighting are essential design considerations.</p></div>

            <div id="container">
            <div class="card"><h3> Wall Decor and Interior Accents</h3></div>
            <div class="card2"><p>Capiz shell is widely used as an accent material for walls, 
                adding texture and elegance to interior spaces. It appears in wall tiles, 
                mosaics, murals, framed panels, and decorative inlays, often combined 
                with wood, metal, or stone to create visual contrast.</p>
                <p> The shell’s pearlescent surface reflects light subtly, making walls 
                    appear more dynamic and layered rather than flat. Designers frequently 
                    use Capiz as a feature wall or focal point in reception areas, lobbies, 
                    hallways, and dining spaces. Its natural patterns and slight irregularities 
                    give walls a handcrafted, artisanal character that enhances both traditional 
                    and contemporary interiors.</p></div>
