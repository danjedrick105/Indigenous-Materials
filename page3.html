        <h1> Capiz Shell </h1>
        <section class="a">
            <img src="capdes.webp">
        <p> <b>Capiz shell</b> is derived from the windowpane oyster <strong>(Placuna placenta)</strong>, a 
            marine mollusk traditionally harvested in shallow coastal waters of the 
            Philippines. The name “Capiz” originates from the province of Capiz in Panay 
            Island, which historically became a major center for harvesting, processing, 
            and trading this material. For centuries, Capiz shell has been deeply embedded 
            in Filipino culture, craftsmanship, and architectural identity. Capiz shell 
            is best known for its natural translucency, which allows light to pass 
            through softly while diffusing glare. Unlike glass, it produces a warm, 
            gentle glow that creates a calming and elegant atmosphere. When processed and 
            polished, Capiz shells exhibit a pearly sheen with subtle organic textures, 
            making each piece visually unique.</p>

        <h2> Types of Capiz Shell </h2>
        <h3> Natural Capiz </h3>
        <p> Natural Capiz refers to Capiz shells that are minimally processed in order to 
            preserve their original appearance and organic characteristics. This type 
            retains the shell’s natural pearly white to off-white translucence, which 
            gently filters light and produces a soft, diffused glow. Each piece of 
            Natural Capiz is unique, displaying subtle variations in thickness, texture, 
            and tone, as well as fine striations and irregular edges that reflect its 
            marine origin.</p>

        <p> The natural imperfections found in this type are highly valued, as they 
            contribute to its authenticity and artisanal quality. Rather than appearing 
            uniform or artificial, Natural Capiz emphasizes the beauty of natural 
            materials and traditional craftsmanship. Because of this, it is widely used 
            in heritage restorations, particularly in Spanish-era bahay na bato houses, 
            churches, and historical structures where Capiz shells were originally used 
            as window panes.</p>

        <p> In contemporary design, Natural Capiz is favored in minimalist, tropical, 
            and eco-inspired interiors. It complements wood, bamboo, rattan, and other 
            organic materials, making it ideal for spaces that aim to highlight 
            simplicity, sustainability, and cultural identity. Its neutral tone allows 
            it to blend harmoniously with various color palettes while still providing 
            visual texture and depth. </p>
