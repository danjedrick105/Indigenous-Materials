        <h2> 5 Types Of Rattan </h2>
        <h3> 1. Natural(Raw) Rattan</h3>
        <p> Natural or raw rattan refers to rattan poles that are harvested and minimally 
            processed. At this stage, the rattan retains its original light yellow to 
            pale brown color and natural surface texture. It is flexible when freshly 
            cut and gradually hardens as it dries. Raw rattan is commonly used in 
            traditional furniture-making, basketry, and handicrafts, especially in rural 
            communities. Because it has not yet undergone chemical treatment, this type 
            is more vulnerable to insects and moisture, making it more suitable for 
            indoor use or temporary applications unless further treated.</p>
 
        <h3> 2. Treated Rattan </h3>
        <p> Treated rattan undergoes processes such as drying, smoking, boiling, or 
            chemical preservation to improve durability and resistance to pests, fungi, 
            and moisture. Treatment significantly extends the lifespan of rattan, making 
            it suitable for long-term use. This type is widely used in commercial 
            furniture, architectural elements, and interior applications. Treated rattan 
            maintains its flexibility while gaining strength and stability, making it 
            ideal for both functional and decorative purposes in homes, resorts, and 
            public spaces.</p>

        <h3> 3. Skin Rattan (Rattan Peel) </h3>
        <p> Skin rattan refers to the outer layer of the rattan cane, which is peeled 
            into thin strips. These strips are smoother and more uniform in appearance 
            compared to the rattan core. Skin rattan is commonly used for weaving 
            furniture surfaces, chair seats, cabinet panels, baskets, and decorative 
            bindings. Its refined texture allows for intricate patterns and clean 
            finishes, making it popular in both traditional and modern designs.</p>

        <h3> 4. Core Rattan </h3>
        <p> Core rattan comes from the inner solid portion of the rattan cane. It is 
            round, strong, and flexible, making it suitable for structural elements. 
            This type is primarily used for furniture frames, supports, armrests, legs, 
            and load-bearing components. Core rattan provides strength while remaining 
            lightweight, allowing furniture to be durable yet easy to move.</p>

        <h3> 5. Woven or Manufactured Rattan </h3>
        <p> Woven or manufactured rattan refers to rattan that has been processed, 
            shaped, and assembled into panels, mats, or furniture components. This 
            includes hand-woven rattan sheets and modular rattan elements. This type is 
            commonly used in room dividers, wall panels, headboards, ceiling accents, 
            and decorative screens, particularly in tropical and contemporary interiors. 
            It showcases craftsmanship while allowing greater design flexibility.</p>
