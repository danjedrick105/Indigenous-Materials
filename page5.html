            <h3> Anahaw Leaf </h3>
            <p>The Anahaw leaf comes from the Anahaw palm (Saribus rotundifolius), a large fan-shaped palm 
                native to the tropical regions of the Philippines.</p>

    <section class="a">
    <h2> Types Of Anahaw Leaf </h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
        <h3> Fresh Anahaw Leaf</h3>
        <p> Fresh Anahaw leaves are newly harvested leaves that retain their natural green color, moisture, and 
            flexibility. At this stage, the leaf fibers are soft and pliable, making them ideal for shaping, 
            folding, and weaving. Because of this flexibility, fresh Anahaw is commonly used in the initial 
            stages of traditional construction and handicraft production. This type is often utilized for 
            temporary shelters, freshly woven wall panels, event decorations, and ceremonial uses, especially 
            in rural communities and cultural celebrations. However, fresh Anahaw leaves are not typically 
            used for long-term applications, as they are more susceptible to decay, insects, and moisture 
            damage if left untreated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
        <h3> Dried Anahaw Leaf </h3>
        <p> Dried Anahaw leaf is the most commonly used type for construction and decorative purposes. After 
            harvesting, the leaves are sun-dried to remove moisture, resulting in a lighter weight and 
            increased durability. The color changes from green to light brown, beige, or golden tan, giving 
            it a warm and natural appearance. This type is widely used for roofing, wall cladding, ceilings, 
            and partitions, particularly in traditional houses, beach huts, eco-resorts, and rest houses. 
            Dried Anahaw provides effective shade, resists heat, and allows air circulation, making it highly 
            suitable for the tropical climate of the Philippines. With proper installation and maintenance, 
            dried Anahaw leaves can last several years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
        <h3> Treated Anahaw Leaf </h3>
        <p> Treated Anahaw leaves undergo additional processing to improve their strength, lifespan, and 
            resistance to environmental factors. Treatment methods may include natural preservatives, 
            saltwater soaking, smoking, or eco-friendly chemical solutions to protect against insects, mold, 
            and moisture. This type is preferred for semi-permanent and long-term structures, such as resort 
            buildings, outdoor pavilions, gazebos, and cultural centers. Treated Anahaw retains its natural 
            appearance while offering improved durability, making it suitable for both functional and 
            aesthetic applications in modern eco-friendly architecture.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="column">
        <h3> Pressed Anahaw Leaf</h3>
        <p> Flattened or pressed Anahaw leaves are processed by applying pressure after drying to create a 
            smoother and more uniform surface. This treatment reduces curling and irregularities, making the 
            leaves easier to align and install. This type is commonly used in interior wall panels, ceiling 
            finishes, furniture coverings, and decorative surfaces. Flattened Anahaw is popular in 
            contemporary tropical interiors where designers want a clean, organized look while still using 
            natural materials.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
        <h3>Woven Anahaw Leaf</h3>
        <p> Woven Anahaw leaf is created by interlacing strips or whole sections of leaves using traditional 
            weaving techniques. This process enhances strength and flexibility while adding decorative 
            patterns and textures. Woven Anahaw is widely used for wall panels, room dividers, mats, baskets, 
            bags, fans, and other handicrafts. In architecture, woven panels are often installed in bahay 
            kubo, cottages, and eco-resorts, providing both visual interest and functional ventilation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <h3> Crafted Anahaw Leaf</h3>
            <p> This type refers to Anahaw leaves that are cut, shaped, dyed, or artistically arranged for 
                decorative and artistic purposes. They are commonly used in event styling, cultural 
                installations, stage backdrops, and festive décor. Decorative Anahaw emphasizes visual impact 
                rather than structural performance. It is frequently seen in festivals, tourism displays, and 
                heritage-themed events, symbolizing Filipino culture, creativity, and national identity.</p>

        <h2>Uses And Application</h2>
        <div class="accordion-wrapper">
        <button class="accordion"> Roofing and Shelter Construction </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> One of the most traditional and well-known uses of the Anahaw leaf is in roofing for 
                indigenous houses, huts, and temporary shelters. The large, fan-shaped leaves are dried, 
                layered, and tightly woven to create thatched roofs. When properly installed, Anahaw roofing 
                provides effective protection against sun and rain while allowing natural ventilation. This 
                type of roofing is commonly seen in rural areas, coastal communities, eco-resorts, and 
                cultural villages. Anahaw roofs help keep interior spaces cool, making them ideal for the 
                tropical climate of the Philippines. Their natural appearance also enhances the rustic and 
                organic character of structures, blending harmoniously with the surrounding environment.</p>

        </div>

        <button class="accordion"> Wall Panels and Space Enclosures </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> Anahaw leaves are also used as wall coverings, partitions, and enclosure panels, especially 
                in traditional and semi-permanent structures. The leaves are woven or layered and attached to 
                bamboo or wooden frames to form lightweight walls. These wall applications allow air 
                circulation while providing shade and privacy. They are commonly used in bahay kubo, beach 
                cottages, outdoor kitchens, and rest huts. In modern design, Anahaw panels are sometimes 
                incorporated into eco-friendly architecture and tropical-themed interiors as a natural 
                alternative to synthetic wall materials.</p>
            <img src="anahawuses2.jpg">
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"> Ceiling Treatments and Interior Accents </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> In both traditional and contemporary spaces, Anahaw leaves are used for ceiling finishes and 
                decorative overhead treatments. Dried and flattened leaves are arranged in patterns and 
                secured to ceiling frames, creating a warm, textured surface that softens interior spaces.
                Anahaw ceilings are popular in resorts, spas, restaurants, and vacation homes, where a relaxed, 
                tropical ambiance is desired. When combined with natural lighting or warm artificial light, 
                the leaf texture adds depth and character while reinforcing a connection to nature.</p>

        </div>
        <button class="accordion"> Furniture Coverings and Decorative Elements </button>
        <div class="panel"> 
            <p> Anahaw leaves are used as surface coverings and decorative components for furniture such as 
                chairs, benches, tables, headboards, and cabinets. They may be woven, layered, or laminated 
                onto wooden frames to create natural textures. Furniture enhanced with Anahaw leaf accents is 
                valued for its handcrafted appearance and cultural identity. These pieces are often featured in 
                eco-lodges, native-themed interiors, and outdoor seating areas, where durability, breathability, 
                and aesthetic warmth are important.</p>
            <img src="anahawuses4.jpg">
        </div>
        <button class="accordion"> Handicrafts and Artisan Products </button>
        <div class="panel"> 
            <p> Anahaw leaf plays a significant role in Filipino handicrafts and traditional artisan products. 
                Skilled craftsmen use the leaves to create fans, baskets, trays, mats, bags, hats, placemats, 
                and decorative wall pieces. The flexibility and size of the leaves make them easy to shape 
                into functional and ornamental items. These handcrafted products are widely sold in local 
                markets, cultural fairs, and souvenir shops, supporting local livelihoods and preserving 
                traditional weaving techniques passed down through generations.</p>

        <button class="accordion"> Event, Cultural, and Festive Decorations</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> Anahaw leaves are commonly used as decorative elements in festivals, cultural events, and 
                traditional celebrations. They are applied in arches, backdrops, stage décor, and ceremonial 
                installations, particularly in rural fiestas and heritage-themed events. Because of their 
                large size and recognizable form, Anahaw leaves create a strong visual impact while symbolizing 
                Filipino pride, resilience, and cultural heritage. Their use in public celebrations reinforces 
                the leaf’s identity as the national leaf of the Philippines.</p>

        </div>
        <button class="accordion"> Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Architecture </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> In modern applications, Anahaw leaf is increasingly used in sustainable and eco-conscious 
                design projects. Architects and designers incorporate Anahaw into green buildings to reduce 
                reliance on synthetic materials and minimize environmental impact. Its renewable nature, biodegradability, 
                and low processing requirements make it suitable for temporary structures, eco-resorts, outdoor 
                pavilions, and sustainable housing concepts. Anahaw leaf helps promote environmentally 
                responsible construction while celebrating local materials.</p>
