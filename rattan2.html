        <h2> 7 Uses And Application of Rattan </h2>
        <h3> Furniture and Furnishings</h3>
        <img src="rattanfurniture.webp">
        <p> Rattan is best known for its extensive use in furniture production, including 
            chairs, sofas, tables, beds, shelves, cabinets, and lounge seating. Its 
            combination of strength and flexibility allows furniture to be both sturdy 
            and comfortable. Rattan furniture is widely used in homes, hotels, resorts, 
            cafés, and outdoor lounges, especially in tropical settings such as those 
            found in the Philippines. Its breathable structure makes it ideal for warm 
            climates, providing comfort without trapping heat.</p>
        
        <h3> Interior Design and Architectural Elements </h3>

        <p> In architecture and interior design, rattan is used for wall cladding, 
            ceiling panels, room dividers, stair railings, and decorative screens. These 
            applications add texture, warmth, and a natural aesthetic to interior spaces. 
            Rattan architectural features are commonly seen in eco-resorts, restaurants, 
            cultural centers, and modern tropical homes, where natural materials are 
            emphasized to create a relaxed and organic atmosphere.</p>

        <h3> Handicrafts and Woven Products </h3>
        <img src="rattancraft.jpg">
        <p> Rattan plays a major role in Filipino handicrafts, where it is used to 
            create baskets, trays, mats, storage containers, lampshades, and decorative 
            items. These products highlight traditional weaving techniques and support 
            local craftsmanship. Handcrafted rattan items are popular in local markets, 
            souvenir shops, and export products, serving both functional and decorative 
            purposes.</p>

        <h3> Lighting Fixtures </h3>
        <img src="rattanlight.jpg">
        <p> Rattan is widely used in lampshades, pendant lights, lanterns, and floor 
            lamps. When woven, it allows light to pass through in patterned shadows, 
            creating a warm and inviting ambiance. These lighting applications are 
            commonly used in residential interiors, cafés, spas, and hospitality spaces, 
            where mood lighting and natural textures are desired.</p>
        
        <h3> Outdoor and Semi-Outdoor Applications </h3>
        <img src="rattanoutdoor.jpg">
        <p> Due to its lightweight and flexibility, treated rattan is often used in 
            porches, balconies, gazebos, patios, and garden furniture. When properly 
            protected from prolonged moisture exposure, rattan performs well in shaded 
            outdoor environments. Outdoor rattan furniture is especially popular in 
            resort and leisure settings, where comfort, aesthetics, and ease of movement 
            are important.</p>

        <h3> Cultural and Traditional Uses </h3>
        <img src="rattantrad.jpg">
        <p> Traditionally, rattan has been used for household tools, fish traps, binding 
            materials, and agricultural implements. These applications demonstrate 
            rattan’s practicality and adaptability in everyday Filipino life. Its 
            continued use in traditional contexts highlights rattan’s role as a 
            culturally significant and functional local material.</p>
